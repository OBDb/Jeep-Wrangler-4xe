    description: "The Jeep Wrangler 4xe represents the brand's first plug-in hybrid Wrangler variant, integrating electrification into its most iconic model. Based on the four-door Wrangler Unlimited body style, it's visually distinguished by Electric Blue accents on the tow hooks, badging, and hood decal. Powered by a sophisticated plug-in hybrid system combining a 2.0L turbocharged four-cylinder engine with two electric motors—one replacing the conventional alternator and another integrated into the eight-speed automatic transmission—producing a combined 375 HP and 470 lb-ft of torque, making it one of the most powerful Wrangler variants available. The 17 kWh battery pack is mounted under the rear seat, protected by a sealed enclosure that maintains the Wrangler's 30-inch water fording capability. With approximately 21 miles of all-electric range and an efficiency rating of 49 MPGe, it offers significantly improved fuel economy compared to conventional Wranglers while actually enhancing off-road capability through the instant torque delivery of the electric motors. Three selectable driving modes—Hybrid (default), Electric, and eSave—allow the driver to tailor the powertrain operation to specific conditions. Available exclusively in Sahara, Rubicon, and High Altitude trim levels, it maintains all the traditional Wrangler features including removable doors, removable top (hard top or soft top), and folding windshield. The Rubicon 4xe specifically maintains the same off-road equipment as the conventional Rubicon including 33-inch tires, electronic locking differentials, electronic disconnecting sway bar, and Rock-Trac 4x4 system with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio. As the best-selling plug-in hybrid in America since its introduction, the Wrangler 4xe demonstrates how electrification can complement rather than compromise the core attributes of Jeep's most capable vehicle, combining tradition with modern powertrain technology."
